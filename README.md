## 'Herkyles' is a project made during Software Engineering Project class - Spring 2018. 

### Here is a project structure

* All the components are in `/app/components` directory. Following the directory is a `Component.js file`, `index.js` and `styles.js` files. eg

> /app/components/ComponentName/ComponentName.js <br>
> /app/components/ComponentName/index.js <br>
> /app/components/ComponentName/styles.js <br>

* As you see, each component has `index` and `styles` file.

* Different pages in the app is captured in `/screens` directory. eg the following path is a Home page. 
> /screens/Home.js

* Database configuration is in `/db/DbConfig.js` file. 
* `/app/index.js` is a file as an entry point of all components in app directory. It acts as a bridge between `app` dirctory and `App.js` file.
